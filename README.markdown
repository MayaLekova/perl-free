A parser for the [CFDG language](http://contextfreeart.org/) written in perl.

The goal of this project is to give a command-line interface much like the unix command-line tool for cfdg(which you can find [here](http://contextfreeart.org/mediawiki/index.php/Download_page)) with an ability to generate png/jpg files as well as svg.
